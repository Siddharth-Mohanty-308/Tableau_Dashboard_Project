#### ðŸ’¡ Play with the moving average duration and moving average period values to see how the graph and heatmap change

### Steps to ceate the dashboard
---
#### Downloaded the dataset on london bike sharing (london_merged.csv) from kaggle
#### Created a python notebook for data cleaning and transformation
#### Saved the final dataframe to a excel file (london_bikes) for visualization
#### Created a total of 5 visualizations 
##### First visualization is the moving average graph that plots number of bike rides against time. It also contaims 3 floating filters to select duration, period(day,week,month) and the range for which you want to plot the graph
##### Second tile contains the number of total bike rides between a period, it changes based on the portion of the graph you select.
##### Then we have a heatmap that of temperature vs windspeed, it shows in which temperature and wind speed have the highest number of bike rides
##### 2 Visualizations for tooltips (Hover over heatmap or graph to view visuals)
